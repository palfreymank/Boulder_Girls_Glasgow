<h1>What is Bouldering?</h1>
<p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing stripped down to the raw essentials. It is done on artificial rock walls, known as boulders, we don't use ropes or harnesses. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the sequence of moves that a climber performs to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20 ft.) tall. Traverses, which are a form of boulder problem, require the climber to climb horizontally from one end to another. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors and way from the rain.</p>
